#### Note: Exercise 3 has multiple parts
- Part 1 is the reaction that depends on [Urea]
- Part 2.1 is the oregonator reaction
- Part 2.2 is the 3D spatial animation (the same as Part 2.1 but with diffusion across multiple cells) (its quite slow but an example output is shown)
- General Case is the same as Part 2.1 but takes an input from the text file (input.txt) in the same folder
#### Run Exercise3main.py to select which part to run.
- Part 2.2 takes a fair while to run, so Part2BOutput.mp4 is provided as an example output.
